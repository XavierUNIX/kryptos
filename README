WARNING: Always back up your pair of Asymmetric Keys, and make sure you can decrypt your original files after encrytion.

					KRYPTOS USE:

	1. Place only one pair of keys either 3,072-bits or 4,224-bits at /Users/kryptos/keys/		(k is a lower-case!)
	   * DO NOT MIX THE KEYS THEY ARE UNIQUE ASYMMETRIC PAIRS AND ALWAYS BACK THEM UP!

	2. kryptos_enc App: Always copy files to be encrypted to a temporary directory then
	   - Select Source  -> is a temporary directory with files to be encrypted
	   - Destination    -> is a unique directory to place the ciphers. Example for absolute path where '*' means all possible names: /Users/<user>/*

	3. kryptos_dec App:
	   - Select Source  -> is the exact unique directory you used to encrypt the files you're trying to decrypt Ex: /Users/<user>/*
	   - Destination    -> you can retrive files to any temporary directory.
